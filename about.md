I’ve helped build a wide range of digital products with an array of teams. I enjoy the challenge of building sophisticated web applications. That are both performant and user friendly. Whilst maintaining a codebase and team environment that others enjoy working within.

I have over 10 years experience working across the full-stack, in a variety of languages and frameworks. Specialising in front-end development. Right now I'm enjoying building user interfaces with React and TypeScript. When it comes to the server side, my primary experience is with Node.js. I've been working with Elixir and Phoenix in side projects.

I’m currently spending my days working with a great bunch of people on the Design System team at Atlassian.
